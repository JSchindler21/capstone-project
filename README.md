# Travel like a Pro - is a Travel App. 

The app helps you to keep an eye on your costs during a trip. 
I built an expense tracker for this. Here you can enter your desired travel destination and existing budget, 
as well as the individual expenses via a form. Which are then displayed in the history and also what is left of the budget. 
On the other hand, it should help you plan your trip better through inspiration. 
Data was written in the background, which in turn is output in cards to get inspiration for new travel destinations. 
There is also a form where you can enter travel data yourself, which will be saved.
